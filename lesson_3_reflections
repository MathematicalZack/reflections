When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your project or work on it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Remaining always up to date may mean that you have broken code at times when you are depending on it not being broken.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is an exact copy of another repository either locally, or from a remote source. A branch is a segment of a commit history
that is separate from another segment. A fork is a clone of a repository within GitHub's servers. You would clone a repo when
you want to have it locally, or contribute to it. You would branch when you do not want the current branch to be affected by
a series of commits you intend to make. You would fork when you want to copy a repo to your GitHub account and maintain credit
for the previous owner.
