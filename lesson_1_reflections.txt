How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing a diff between the two versions allowed me to rapidly spot the bug,
as it did not show me all the code which was exactly the same between the files.
Doing this made the differences apparent, and thus made the bug apparent, 
as the bug was a result of previous changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It saves old work, so if you must revert you are able to do so.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use the git log to see all the revisions along with their revision messages. This helps you easily
locate old changes. Diff allows you to see the changes made between revisions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Using version control allows you to go back and see when and why a bug is present. If you introduce a bad
bug you can always revert and submit changes to fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Making video games with friends!
