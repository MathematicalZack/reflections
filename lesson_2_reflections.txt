What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a .git file which is used to store
snapshots of files during commits. This will hold your version history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is where the actual changes are committed to once they have been committed from the staging area
The staging area allows you to package changes easily without simply submitting all changes. This helps
with the notion of 'logical change'.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
When you have made more than one logical change between commits, you can use the staging area to put
them in one at a time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches could be useful for experimenting with a concept that you are not sure you want to
integrate into the master code base.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They demonstrate the structure graphically to understand it as a series of steps
