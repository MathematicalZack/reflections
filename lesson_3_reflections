When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your project or work on it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Remaining always up to date may mean that you have broken code at times when you are depending on it not being broken.
